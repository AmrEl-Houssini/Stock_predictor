# Predictive view
A stock predictor for Ford motors (F) stock price using ML, DL and statistical models, as micro-service using FastAPI.



In this project we (the graduation project team) have done a time series forecasting technique to help beginners take action of buy or sell in the present time to be able to profit in the future,
The technique used is an ensemble learning technique between classical ML models (linear, ridge, and SVR), FBprophet, statistical model (ARIMA) and DL models (LSTM and transformer) to finally get the most possible accurate decision from the predictions of our 5 optimized models.



On the technical side, I was responsible for building the LSTM and Prophet models, also participated in building ARIMA model and the deployment of all models with FastAPI , also I was responsible for the whole presentation phase from building interesting and informative [presentation](https://prezi.com/view/g9gDQpjwgO4ssvAiwq5k/)
using Prezi NEXT till organizing the talk between the team while pitching.

On the leading side, I have maintained the positive and collaborative team spirit between us by a consistent motivation even at our most stressful times and avoiding any tension 
or differences by constructive criticism or voting between us.
